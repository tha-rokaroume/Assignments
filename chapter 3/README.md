# Assignment

To write a neural network that can take two inputs:
an image from MNIST dataset, and
a random number between 0 and 9

and gives two outputs:

the "number" that was represented by the MNIST image, and
the "sum" of this number with the random number that was generated and sent as the input to the network

## Data Representation
The inputs come from a 28x28 image from MNIST and a random number from 0 to 9.

## Data Generation Strategy
We use a modified version of MNIST class called MNISTRandAdder.
It adds a random number along with the mnist image, and the target now is the mnist image's target + the random number
    *For example: [MNIST Image for 1], 5 => 1, 6*

## Loss function
Cross entropy measures entropy between two probability distributions and since we're dealing with different classes we chose cross entropy.

## Result
